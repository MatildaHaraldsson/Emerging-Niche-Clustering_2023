# Data
## Parameters

* ```parameters.R``` All parameter combinations used in the 864.000 simulations.

## Simulation results

* ```datCorr.R``` Successful simulation and clustering results for the predator- prey model with correlated competition and predator interaction niche axes.
* ```datUncorr.R``` Successful simulation and clustering results for the predator- prey model with uncorrelated competition and predator interaction niche axes.
* ```datComp.R``` Successful simulation and clustering results for the competition model without predators.
