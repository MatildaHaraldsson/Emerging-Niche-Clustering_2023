# Figures

## Figure Code
Codes to reproduce figures 1-4 in the main text of Haraldsson and Th√©bault 2023. The codes demands the data objects below, as well as the ```Library_Emerging_niche_clustering.R``` script stored in the ```Code/``` folder, and the output stored in the ```Data/``` folder.

- ```Figure_1.R```: reproduces figure 1
- ```Figure_2_3.R```: reproduces figure 2 and 3
- ```Figure_4.R```: reproduces figure 4

## Figure Data
